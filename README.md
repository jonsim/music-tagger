music_tagger
============

A small program to tidy music files. It recursively explores a given directory and standardises 
folder structures, file naming conventions and ID3 tags.

In more detail, the program should explore a given directory and extract song information from the 
folder structure (if it is artist/album/song.mp3), the file name and any applicable ID3 tags (either 
v1 or v2 or both). The correct information (from these 3 potential sources) is then decided upon 
before the folder structure is updated (to artist/album/song.mp3), the file renamed appropriately 
(to "TRACKNUM Song Title.mp3") and is correctly tagged (with both an ID3v1.1 and an ID3v2.3.0 tag).

The project is released under the GPLv3 license.

Note: I also have a small test directory structure containing a few sample music files in the 
repository, however for copyright reasons I have not committed them. Should you want to work on the 
project I would recommend that you replicate this setup by copying a few albums into the repository 
for testing purposes.


TODO:
- Add some type of voting procedure to decide on the correct album/artist/track name from the 
available information (file path, ID3v1 tag, ID3v2 tag).


EXTENSIONS:
- It would be nice to be able to have the program produce several versions of the file at different 
bit rates for different device usage (e.g. mobile devices would take 128-196 kbps, desktop devices 
would take 320 kbps).
