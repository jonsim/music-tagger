music_tagger
============

A small program to tidy music files. It recursively explores a given directory and standardises folder structures, file naming conventions and ID3 tags.

NB: I also have a small test directory structure containing various music files (with horrendous/mismatched tags) in the repository, however for copyright reasons I have not committed them. Should you want to clone the project I would recommend that you replicate this setup by copying a few (I use 4) albums into the repository for testing purposes.
